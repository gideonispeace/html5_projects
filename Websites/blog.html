    		<h3>Psalms 91</h3>
    		<small>Posted By Giddy on June 13</small>
    		<p>Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
               will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.[a]
               I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress,
               my God, in whom I trust.”</p>

    		<h3>Psalms 93</h3>
    		<small>Posted By Giddy on June 13</small>
    		<p>The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed in majesty and
    		   is armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
    		   Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity. The seas have lifted up,
    		   O LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves
    		   Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea--
    		   the LORD on high is mighty. Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O LORD.</p>

    		<h3>1 Corinthians 9 19-20</h3>
    		<small>Posted By Giddy on June 13</small>
    		<p>19 Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.
    		20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law
    		(though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law.</p>
